# 🚛 Introduction

Fleet management is one of the most critical components of modern logistics and transportation industries. Organizations managing fleets of vehicles often struggle with maintaining accurate records of drivers, vehicle utilization, maintenance schedules, fuel consumption, operational costs, and overall business analytics.

Traditional fleet management systems rely heavily on spreadsheets, manual records, disconnected software solutions, and human intervention. These methods introduce delays, increase operational costs, and make data-driven decision-making difficult.

**LogiFleet** is a modern full-stack Fleet Management System that digitizes the complete fleet lifecycle. It enables organizations to efficiently manage vehicles, drivers, maintenance activities, trips, fuel usage, expenses, and reports while ensuring secure access through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). 

The application is built using **React**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **Prisma ORM**, and **PostgreSQL**, following a scalable layered architecture suitable for enterprise-grade deployments.

# ❗ Problem Statement

Logistics companies today face numerous operational challenges that impact productivity, efficiency, and profitability:
* **Manual Vehicle Management:** Vehicle information is typically stored in Excel sheets or physical registers, making it difficult to track availability, maintenance history, and utilization rates.
* **Driver Mismanagement:** Organizations struggle to monitor driver license expirations, active availabilities, safety metrics, and historical trip logs.
* **Poor Maintenance Tracking:** Maintenance schedules are often managed reactively rather than proactively, resulting in delayed servicing, unexpected on-road breakdowns, and high asset depreciation.
* **Fuel Leakage & Cost Tracking:** Without centralized, trip-tied logging, fuel expenses become difficult to audit, introducing severe vulnerabilities to operational financial losses.
* **Lack of Business Intelligence:** Managers cannot accurately determine critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Fleet Utilization rates, Vehicle ROI, exact Operational Cost-per-mile, Fuel Efficiency metrics, and Driver Productivity profiles.
* **Weak Security:** Legacy systems lack granular authentication and authorization mechanisms, exposing highly sensitive logistics data to unauthorized eyes.

* **Granular RBAC Guards:** Middleware intercepts queries to confirm that incoming payloads match the privileges assigned to the user's role.

### Strict Validation Rules (Zod Schemas)
* **Vehicles:** Enforces specific alphanumeric structures on VIN strings, requiring positive floating-point values for load limits and vehicle costs.
* **Drivers:** Validates that license expiry inputs sit cleanly in future chronological windows.
* **Trips:** Runs automated cross-entity checks before confirming a trip:

$$\text{Trip Allowed} = (\text{Driver Available} \land \text{Vehicle Available} \land \text{Driver License Valid} \land \text{Cargo Weight} \le \text{Vehicle Capacity})$$

---

# ⚡ Performance Optimizations

* **Database Indexing Strategics:** Custom indexes applied across frequently filtered fields (`vehicleId`, `driverId`, `tripStatus`) to accelerate query performance.
* **Prisma Subquery Selectors:** Queries specify exact required datasets to avoid large `SELECT *` lookups and keep payloads lightweight.
